# Tutorial Finder AI

## Project Overview

Tutorial Finder AI is an advanced search and content generation platform designed to help users find specific tutorials for games, technologies, and other topics with greater precision than traditional search engines. The platform not only locates existing tutorials but can also generate custom tutorials when none exist, delivering results in both text and audio/video formats with natural-sounding explanations.

Unlike conventional search engines, Tutorial Finder AI uses specialized NLP, multi-source integration, and conversational refinement to provide highly targeted results. The system creates audio/video explanations using natural language processing that sound conversational rather than AI-generated, making complex tutorials more accessible and easier to follow.

## Implementation Plan

Based on the project documentation, we're implementing the system in phases, starting with the core search functionality:

### Phase 1: Core Search Functionality
1. **Frontend Setup**: Implement the homepage/search interface with React and Material-UI
2. **Backend API**: Create the search service with Node.js/Express and initial API endpoints
3. **Search Results**: Develop the search results page with filtering capabilities
4. **Tutorial Viewer**: Build basic tutorial viewing components for different content types

### Phase 2: Content Integration
1. Connect to external APIs (YouTube, gaming platforms)
2. Implement web scraping for additional sources
3. Create content normalization and quality assessment

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Conversational search refinement
2. Tutorial generation for missing content
3. Audio/video processing and playback

## Project Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive planning documentation for the Tutorial Finder AI project. Before beginning development, we've created detailed specifications to ensure a well-thought-out implementation.

### Documentation Structure

- **[Requirements](docs/requirements.md)**: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the system
- **[Use Cases](docs/use_cases.md)**: Comprehensive use case scenarios showing how different users will interact with the system
- **[System Architecture](docs/system_architecture.md)**: Technical architecture and component design
- **[Data Flow Diagram](docs/data_flow_diagram.md)**: Visualization of how data moves through the system
- **[Risk Assessment](docs/risk_assessment.md)**: Analysis of potential challenges and mitigation strategies

## Key Features

- **Advanced Tutorial Search**: Multi-source integration with specialized filters for games, genres, and question types
- **AI-Powered Tutorial Generation**: Creation of custom tutorials when existing content doesn't meet user needs
- **Natural Voice Explanations**: Conversational audio/video output that explains tutorials in an accessible way
- **Personalized Results**: Adaptive search that learns from user preferences and behavior
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Web, mobile, and potential game overlay integrations

## Development Approach

The project will follow a phased development approach as outlined in the roadmap document. This allows for iterative delivery of value while managing complexity and risk. The system is designed with a modular architecture to enable independent scaling and development of components.

## Getting Started

This repository currently contains planning documentation only. Development will begin according to the phases outlined in the project roadmap.

## Contributing

Contribution guidelines will be established once development begins.

## License

License information will be added prior to development.
