- **Media Formatter**: Prepares content for different playback environments

### 4. Data Layer

#### 4.1 Content Repository
- **Tutorial Database**: Stores structured tutorial content
- **Media Storage**: Manages audio and video assets
- **Search Index**: Optimizes content for fast retrieval
- **Version Control**: Maintains history of content changes

#### 4.2 User Data Store
- **User Profiles**: Stores user preferences and history
- **Interaction Logs**: Records user interactions for personalization
- **Feedback Database**: Maintains user ratings and comments

#### 4.3 Knowledge Graph
- **Entity Relationships**: Maps connections between games, techniques, concepts
- **Taxonomy**: Hierarchical classification of tutorial topics
- **Semantic Network**: Connects related concepts for improved search

## Data Flow

### Search Flow
1. User submits query through frontend interface
2. API Gateway authenticates request and routes to Search Service
3. Query Analyzer processes and enriches the query
4. Search Orchestrator dispatches parallel searches to:
   - Content Repository (for existing tutorials)
   - External APIs (for platform-specific content)
   - Web Scrapers (for recent or specialized content)
5. Result Aggregator combines, deduplicates, and ranks results
6. Results are returned to the user with preview options
7. User interactions with results are logged for future optimization

### Tutorial Generation Flow
1. System identifies missing tutorial based on failed searches or explicit request
2. Gap Analyzer assesses feasibility of generating the tutorial
3. Content Planner creates structural outline based on similar tutorials
4. LLM Orchestrator sends generation requests to appropriate models
5. Content Generator assembles complete tutorial from model outputs
6. Quality Checker reviews for accuracy, completeness, and clarity
7. Generated tutorial is stored in Content Repository and indexed
8. User receives notification that custom tutorial is available

### Audio/Video Creation Flow
1. User selects audio/video option for a tutorial
2. Media Processing Service retrieves tutorial content
3. Text-to-Speech Engine converts content to natural speech
4. Audio Editor optimizes audio quality and pacing
5. For video content, Video Generator creates visual components
6. Media Formatter prepares final output in requested format
7. Content is streamed to user through Media Player
8. Usage analytics are captured for quality improvement

## Scalability and Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
- Each microservice is containerized for independent scaling
- Auto-scaling rules based on request volume and processing load
- Read replicas for databases to handle increased query volume

### Performance Optimizations
- Content caching at multiple levels (CDN, API Gateway, Services)
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
- Background pre-generation of likely requested content
- Database sharding for improved query performance

### Resilience Patterns
- Circuit breakers for external service dependencies
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Fallback strategies for degraded operation
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Security Architecture

### Authentication and Authorization
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect for user authentication
- Role-based access control for administrative functions
- API keys with scoped permissions for external integrations

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest for all stored data
- TLS for all data in transit
- PII anonymization where appropriate
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### API Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- OWASP top 10 protection measures
- API versioning and deprecation policies
