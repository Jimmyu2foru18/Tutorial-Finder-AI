# Tutorial Finder AI - Project Requirements

## Project Overview

Tutorial Finder AI is an advanced search and content generation platform designed to help users find specific tutorials for games, technologies, and other topics with greater precision than traditional search engines. The platform will not only locate existing tutorials but can also generate custom tutorials when none exist, delivering results in both text and audio/video formats with natural-sounding explanations.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Advanced Tutorial Search System

- **Multi-source Integration**: Integrate with multiple data sources including:
  - Video platforms (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)
  - Gaming platforms (Steam, Epic Games, etc.)
  - Tutorial websites and forums
  - Developer documentation
  - Educational platforms

- **Search Refinement Engine**:
  - Implement NLP-based query understanding to extract intent, topic, and specificity
  - Create a multi-step refinement process that narrows search results based on user feedback
  - Develop specialized filters for game genres, question types, and skill levels
  - Support complex queries with multiple parameters

- **Web Scraping System**:
  - Design ethical web scrapers for tutorial content extraction
  - Implement content classification and quality assessment
  - Create a database for storing and indexing scraped content

### 2. Tutorial Generation System

- **Gap Analysis**:
  - Develop algorithms to identify missing tutorials based on user queries
  - Create a ranking system for tutorial requests

- **AI Tutorial Creation**:
  - Implement LLM-based tutorial generation for topics with no existing content
  - Design templates for different tutorial types (how-to, walkthrough, troubleshooting)
  - Include code generation capabilities for programming tutorials

### 3. Natural Language Processing & Output

- **Voice Synthesis**:
  - Implement natural-sounding voice synthesis for tutorial narration
  - Support multiple voices and speaking styles
  - Optimize for gaming terminology pronunciation

- **Conversational Explanation**:
  - Develop algorithms to transform formal tutorial content into conversational explanations
  - Implement context-aware explanation generation
  - Create a system for adjusting explanation complexity based on user expertise

### 4. User Interface & Experience

- **Search Interface**:
  - Design an intuitive search interface with advanced filtering options
  - Implement search suggestions and auto-completion
  - Create a history system for previous searches

- **Results Presentation**:
  - Develop a clean, organized results display
  - Implement preview capabilities for tutorials
  - Create a rating and feedback system

- **Audio/Video Player**:
  - Integrate a custom media player for tutorial playback
  - Support for transcripts and closed captions
  - Implement playback speed and navigation controls

### 5. Backend Infrastructure

- **Scalable Architecture**:
  - Design a microservices architecture for independent scaling of components
  - Implement caching strategies for frequent queries
  - Develop a robust API for frontend-backend communication

- **Data Storage**:
  - Design database schemas for user data, tutorial content, and search indexes
  - Implement efficient storage solutions for media content
  - Create backup and recovery systems

### 6. Integration & APIs

- **External APIs**:
  - Integrate with YouTube API, Steam API, and other relevant platforms
  - Implement authentication and rate limiting
  - Create fallback mechanisms for API failures

- **AI Model Integration**:
  - Integrate with LLMs for content generation and query understanding
  - Implement voice synthesis APIs
  - Create a pipeline for model updates and improvements

## Non-functional Requirements

### 1. Performance

- Search results should be returned within 2 seconds
- Tutorial generation should complete within 30 seconds
- System should support at least 1000 concurrent users

### 2. Security

- Implement secure user authentication
- Protect user search history and preferences
- Secure API keys and external service credentials

### 3. Scalability

- Architecture should support horizontal scaling
- Database should handle growing content repository
- Search index should optimize for increasing query volume

### 4. Reliability

- System should have 99.9% uptime
- Implement graceful degradation for component failures
- Create comprehensive error handling and logging

### 5. Usability

- Interface should be accessible to users with varying technical expertise
- Mobile and desktop responsive design
- Intuitive navigation and clear feedback mechanisms

## Constraints

- Ethical web scraping practices must be followed
- Copyright and intellectual property rights must be respected
- Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) must be adhered to
- System must be designed for future internationalization
